# Guess the Number Game
In this project, I used Java to create a simple guess the number game.

## How it works 
The console will firstly ask you for your name, then the range you want to guess from, and we use math.Random to generate a random number between 1 and the number the user inputs.
Finally, the console asks the user the number of attempts they want in order to guess the number, if the user answers correctly, they win. If the user does not answer correctly within the number of attempts they set, it's game over.

## What I learned
I learned basic OOP principles, such as inheritance, abstraction and encapsulation to build this project. I also learned about constructors, as well as getter/accessors used to facilitate my code.

This was my first Java project, and I thoroughly enjoyed building it. I am looking forward to continuing my journey with learning Java, and consequently buildiing more complex and exciting projects!
